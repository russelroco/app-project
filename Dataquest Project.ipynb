    "# An Analysis of a Profitable App Profile for the App Store and Google Play Markets\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "Hello, I'm Russel, and this is my first data analysis project! I've been using this website called Data Quest to help me learn the syntax, concepts, and skills needed to perform data analysis with Python. This is my first guided project after finishing their Fundamentals in Python course. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data Quest guided projects are great because they're able to teach you the process of analysis that must be adopted to achieve project goals. For instance, in cleaning data, some matters may evade my judgement (we'll discuss this more later). But because I had the guide from Data Quest, I was able to avoid those pitfalls. Now, moving forward in my data science career, I have added all these considerations to my mental toolbox for my future data analysis projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project Brief\n",
    "The guided project starts with the premise that we work for a company that develops apps for the English market on both Android and iOS. These apps are then made available on Google Play and App Store, free to download and install. The primary source of revenue for the company is driven by in-app ads and in-app purchases. This means that revenue is heavily driven by the size of the user base of the app - the more users who see and engage with ads and the more users who purchase in-app add-ons, the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal: Analyze data from Google Play and Apple Store to help developers understand user preferences and recommend an app profile that is most likely to attract users."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "#### Data Source\n",
    "The first thing we need to do is gather the data that we need for the analysis. As of the third quarter of 2019, Android users have an app base of 2.47 million apps in Google Play. Meanwhile, Apple has 1.8 million apps available in App Store (Statista, 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of gathering data for over 4.27 million apps - which takes up a lot of time, effort, and money - we'll analyze a representative sample of this data. A quick search shows that there currently exists a relevant sample that can cater to our project goal at no cost. On Kaggle, we were able to gather:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A data set containing 10,000 [Android apps from Google Play](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps/home), collected in August 2018. \n",
    "  * A data set containing 7,000 [iOS apps from App Store](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps/home), collected in July 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note the limitations that may exist with our current data, which can lead to risks in drawing conclusions from our analysis. The data sets were gathered from 2017 and 2018, which may affect the timeliness of our recommendation - we will not be able to factor in any market taste changes from the past year. And while the size of the data sets are a good sample for analysis, it is not sufficient to accurately represent the totality of the market. The data sets that we currently have only represent 0.4% of their respective total markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we download both data sets. Then we separate the header from the actual data, this will ease our analysis as we go further."

    "#### Data Cleaning\n",
    "Among data analysts, it's been said that 90% of your time will go towards cleaning your data into a usable form. I say 'among data analysts' with familiarity, because my data analytics elective professor in college said that. \n",
    "\n",
    "Kidding aside, the goal of data cleaning is to detect inaccurate and duplicate data, so we can remove it from our analysis. In identifying possible inaccuracies and errors, the first task is to read discussions on the source site of the data set that you currently have. This was what I was talking about earlier when I said some issues would evade my judgement. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Google Play data set discussion shows an error exists in row 10472. We can observe this by printing out the data around that index. We see that this row, with the app \"Life Made WI-Fi...\" has a missing category column and no data for the genre column. Since the row has an error, we can remove it by using the `del` statement. We need to make sure we don't run this line more than once, otherwise we'll delete more than one row.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, we can read the discussions about the Apple Store Data to see if there are any inaccuracies. From what I could read though, the data set does not have shifted columns or missing content."
